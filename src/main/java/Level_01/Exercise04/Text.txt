 ///===== NANCY BOY from PLACEBO lyrics! =====\\\

 Alcoholic kind of mood
 Lose my clothes, lose my lube
 Cruising for a piece of fun
 Looking out for number one
 Different partner every night
 So narcotic outta sight
 What a gas
 What a beautiful ass
 And it all breaks down at the role reversal
 Got the muse in my head, she's universal
 Spinning me round, she's coming over me
 And it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
 Got the muse in my head, she's universal
 Spinning me round, she's coming over me
 Kind of buzz that last for days
 Had some help from insect ways
 Comes across all shy and coy
 Just another nancy boy
 Woman, man or modern monkey
 Just another happy junkie
 Fifty pounds, press my button
 Going down
 And it all breaks down at the role reversal
 Got the muse in my head, she's universal
 Spinning me round, she's coming over me
 And it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
 Got the muse in my head, she's universal
 Spinning me round, she's coming over me
 Does his make-up in his room
 Douse himself with cheap perfume
 Eyeholes in a paper bag
 Greatest lay I ever had
 Kind of guy who mates for life
 Gotta help him find a wife
 We're a couple
 When our bodies double
 And it all breaks down at the role reversal
 Got the muse in my head, she's universal
 Spinning me round, she's coming over me
 And it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
 Got the muse in my head, she's universal
 Spinning me round, she's coming over me
 And it all breaks down at the role reversal
 Got the muse in my head, she's universal
 Spinning me round, she's coming over me
 And it all breaks down at the first rehearsal
 Got the muse in my head, she's universal
 Spinning me round, she's coming over me
